# gSnap

Gnome-shell extension that allows you to move windows into specific regions similiar to FancyZones on windows.

This extension was built from gTile, stripped it down and changed it to work like FancyZones.  Thanks to all the folks
that worked on gTile as it made my process of developing this much easier.

This extensions is developed in freetime.  Developer got to eat, if you like it, consider buying me a coffee :)

## Installation

[Install From The Gnome Extensions Page](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4442/gsnap/)


### Installation from source
Follow the [Development](./DEVELOPING.md) docs.

### Debugging

If you encounter buggy behavior, it may help to view the log messages gSnap
writes. These may be viewed with the following shell command:

```shell
journalctl --follow /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "gSnap"
```

## Configuration

For configuration, please use the built-in preferences dialog (Gnome Tweak Tool -> Extensions -> gSnap -> Preferences).

* Keyboard shortcuts:
  * Currently you can switch between preconfigured layouts
  * You can set the margins between the windows as well
   
## Edit Layouts:
To edit a layout follow the instructions below
* Click "Edit Layout" (will edit the currently applied layout).
* Left-Click to split the region
* Middle-Click to split with opposite orientation
* Right-Click to remove

When done click "Stop Editing"

Layouts are stored in this file.
```shell
gedit ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gSnap@micahosborne/layouts.json 
```
After editing layouts disable and re-enable the plugin

Layouts are defined via json here is a 50% 50% split layout
```jsonc
  {
    "type": 0, // 0 for horizontal, 1 for vertical
    "length": 100, // Percentage of screen
    "items": [
      {
        "length": 50 // Percentage of parent
      },
      {
        "length": 50
      }
    ]
  }
```
Here is a 3 split configuration, with the column in the middle split into 3 zones
```jsonc
  {
    "length": 100, // 100% of screen
    "items": [
       // Column 1
      {
        "length": 42 // 42% of parent
      },
       // Column 2
      {
        "type": 1, // Layout items in vertical
        "length": 16, // 16% of parent
        "items": [
          {
            "length": 33
          },
          {
            "length": 34
          },
          {
            "length": 33
          }
        ]
      },
       // Column 3
      {
        "length": 42 // 42% of parent
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Usage with interface

1. Make sure the window you want to resize has focus
2. Click and drag a window to see the layouts and snap a window
3. Use the (configurable) shortcuts to switch between layouts. Ctrl+Super+KP[NUM]

Note: Right now the layouts can only be edited from source.  When I have more time i'll make a configuration file, or even and editor for this.  Feel free to contribute
